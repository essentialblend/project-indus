Project Indus
====================================================================================================

Indus is a multithreaded brute-force path-traced renderer. It is my first attempt at fleshing out and applying concepts I learn from various reference texts on graphics, programming, and math.
Presently, it serves as a revision playground which I aim to update immediately upon reaching a learning checkpoint.

Representational image coming soon...

Current Features:
- Developed from scratch using C++.
- Multithreading compatible.
- Per pixel Multi-sampled AA.
- Jittered Aliasing.
- Gamma Correction.
- Positionable camera with defocus blur (DOF).
- Lambertian, Metallic, and Dielectric Materials.
